            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p class="info">
                My name is Cornelius Pussyfoot and I am an aristocat.
                I am not a stray nor am I a mongrel. I am a high-born cat,
                of noble blood, and I demand the respect rightfully due unto
                a feline such as myself. Now then, I shall inform you of the
                civilized pastimes that I am most fond of. My favorite activity
                consists of pawing at a feathered plaything that my servants
                dangle in front of me. It is a demanding task that requires a
                sharp eye and even sharper claws, and it allows me to maintain my sleek,
                athletic build. The rest of my time is spent feasting on the
                delectable foodstuffs that my servants prepare for me. My favorite
                dish is their tuna tartare, garnished with a sprig of catnip.
                It is truly scrumptious.
